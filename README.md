## Introduction

The BCCA Algorithm is designed to identify groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across various conditions. It employs a biclustering approach to discover subsets of genes and conditions that exhibit co-activation, which can be crucial in understanding complex biological processes.

## Features

- **Biclustering:** Discover patterns of co-activated genes across subsets of conditions.
- **Co-Activation Analysis:** Identify relationships and interactions among genes.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate the algorithm's performance using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and purity metrics.
- **Cross-Validation:** Utilize cross-validation for robust evaluation.
